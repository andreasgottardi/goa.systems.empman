# Goa systems employee manager

This is a concept project to show provide simple pdf form to users and gather information from these forms automated in order to transform them into usable data. The example shows how to collect data from the forms and export them into three processable formats.

* JSON
* XML
* SQL

Of course the example can be extended to export the data automatically and data adapters (like JDBC, HTTP, etc.) can be implemented. Therefor the build system "Gradle" is used which allows simple inclusion of libraries and dependencies.
